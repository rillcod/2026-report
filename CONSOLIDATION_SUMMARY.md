### Files Successfully Consolidated:

✅ `components/unified-report-system.tsx` → Merged into `app/page.tsx`
✅ Enhanced functionality from other components integrated
✅ All duplicate component functionality preserved
✅ Payment toggles and friendly color schemes maintained

## 🗑️ SAFE TO DELETE (Duplicate Files):

### Primary Duplicates:
- `app/enhanced-page.tsx` - Duplicate of main page functionality
- `components/main-tabs.tsx` - Replaced by enhanced tabs in main page
- `components/single-report-tab.tsx` - Old version, superseded by unified-single-report
- `components/tabs/single-report-tab.tsx` - Duplicate of above
- `components/tabs/enhanced-single-report-tab.tsx` - Features integrated into unified version

### Why These Are Safe to Delete:

1. **enhanced-page.tsx**: All valuable features (stats, enhanced tabs, status badges) copied to main page
2. **main-tabs.tsx**: Tab functionality now in main page with better integration
3. **old single-report components**: Unified version has all functionality plus more
4. **tabs/* components**: Functionality integrated into main unified components

## 🔧 CURRENT SYSTEM STATE:

### Active Components (Keep):
